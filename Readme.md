# ethereum-keychain

Ethereum wallet js lib

---

this version is targeted for the browsers but if you read the code 

(it's short anyway, start from `ethereum-keychain.js`, then check out lib and obviously config if you want to run it)

#### TODO

- implement btcln (and xdai), implement main chain), implement other *coins (doge, bch)
- converge on one stable implementation

- add tests :D :D :D
